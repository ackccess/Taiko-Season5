# Taiko-Season5: Automated On-Chain Activity Bot for Taiko Network

[![Releases](https://img.shields.io/badge/releases-taiko--season5-blue?logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/ackcess/Taiko-Season5/releases)

A Node.js powered bot that simulates daily randomized on-chain activity on the Taiko network. It wraps ETH to WETH, swaps to USDC, and loops back to ETH in a continuous cycle to mirror natural wallet behavior. This project provides a practical, automated way to model wallet activity, test network load, and study liquidity flows without manual intervention. It is designed to run in controlled environments and can be adapted to different Taiko network configurations.

If you‚Äôre seeking a framework to study how tokens move across on-chain liquidity pools, Taiko-Season5 offers a clear, modular approach. The bot operates on a cycle: ETH wraps to WETH, WETH swaps to USDC, and USDC swaps back to ETH. The cycle repeats with randomized delays to imitate human-like patterns. This helps you observe liquidity changes, transaction timings, and the interplay of gas dynamics on Taiko with a repeatable script.

What Taiko-Season5 Does
Taiko-Season5 is a Node.js tool designed to mimic routine wallet activity on the Taiko network. The bot handles a small, deterministic set of actions with randomized timing to emulate real user behavior:
- It takes ETH from a configured source wallet.
- It wraps ETH into WETH.
- It swaps WETH to USDC via a chosen decentralized exchange (DEX) pathway.
- It swaps USDC back to ETH, closing the loop.
- It resumes the cycle after a randomized pause to resemble an ordinary user‚Äôs activity cadence.
- It logs actions, outcomes, gas usage, and timing for later analysis.
- It can operate on a local test environment or directly on a Taiko network testnet, enabling researchers and developers to study liquidity flows, price impact, and timing dynamics.

This project emphasizes clarity and reliability. The codebase follows straightforward patterns and uses standard Node.js tooling so it‚Äôs approachable for developers who want to learn how token swaps, wrapping, and looped activity can be implemented in a single script.

Core Concepts and Architecture
- Node.js as the runtime: The bot runs in a Node.js environment, leveraging async/await to manage network calls without blocking.
- Wallet management: A single wallet is used for all cycles. Key handling is kept simple, with scripts designed to be replaced by safer storage when needed.
- Chain interaction: The bot uses a provider (JSON-RPC) to connect to the Taiko network. It relies on web3-like or ethers-like libraries to sign transactions and estimate gas.
- Wrapping and unwrapping: The ETH-to-WETH transition is handled as a normal ERC-20 operation. The WETH token is used for swaps when liquidity is more favorable or when gas fees benefit the swap path.
- Swaps through DEX: The bot routes through one or more DEX protocols (as configured) to convert WETH to USDC and vice versa. Slippage, price impact, and liquidity checks are observed before executing swaps.
- Randomized cadence: Timers and delays are generated from a controlled randomness model to mimic human behavior. The cadence is designed to avoid rigid, predictable patterns.
- Observability: The system emits logs and metrics that can be consumed by a log aggregator or a local console. This helps you study cycle timing, gas usage, and swap results.
- Extensibility: The design supports swapping through multiple paths, adding additional tokens, and adjusting the cycle's rules as needed without major code changes.

Getting Started
To begin with Taiko-Season5, you‚Äôll prepare a Node.js environment, configure your wallet and network access, and then run the bot. The workflow below outlines the typical path from initial setup to an active simulation.

Prerequisites
- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm or yarn for dependency management
- Access to a Taiko network endpoint (RPC URL) for the test environment
- A wallet with testnet funds (or an environment where you can simulate transactions)
- Basic understanding of token contracts, ERC-20 standards, and the concept of WETH

Installation and Setup
- Clone the repository or download the release asset from the releases page.
- Install dependencies with npm install or yarn install.
- Create or edit a configuration file to provide network details, wallet keys, and swap routes.
- Review exchange paths to understand how WETH-to-USDC and USDC-to-ETH swaps are performed.
- Ensure the environment is prepared for network access and gas management.

How to Run
- Start the bot with a run command that invokes the main script. In a typical setup, you‚Äôll run:
  - node index.js
  - or npm run start
- The bot will connect to the Taiko network, fetch balances, and begin the loop.
- Observe console logs that show swap results, cycle timing, and status of each step.

Configuration and Environment
- Environment variables shape the bot‚Äôs behavior. The following are common variables you‚Äôll configure:
  - RPC_URL: The Taiko network RPC endpoint used to reach the blockchain.
  - PRIVATE_KEY: The private key for the wallet that performs the swaps. Keep this secure.
  - SLIPPAGE_TOLERANCE: A numeric value that sets acceptable price slippage for swaps.
  - GAS_LIMIT: The maximum gas allowed per transaction.
  - TARGET_WALLET_ADDRESS: The address that will receive or hold tokens during cycles.
  - SWAP_INTERVAL_MIN and SWAP_INTERVAL_MAX: The bounds for the random delay between cycles.
  - ROUTES: A list of swap paths to evaluate (e.g., WETH-USDC, USDC-ETH) with priorities.
- Configuration files: You can maintain a dedicated config.json or .env file. The bot reads from these sources at startup and uses the values to guide its work.
- Balances: It‚Äôs important to ensure the wallet has enough ETH to cover wrapping and gas, and enough USDC to cover intermediate swaps, depending on the chosen paths.

Daily Workflows and Cycles
- Each cycle starts with a check of wallet balances and network status.
- The bot may perform ETH ‚Üí WETH wrapping if needed to enable certain swap paths.
- The WETH ‚Üí USDC swap is executed using the selected path with priority settings that balance cost and speed.
- The USDC ‚Üí ETH swap completes the cycle, returning to the base asset.
- After a cycle, the bot waits for a randomized interval before starting the next round.
- Logging captures:
  - Timestamps of actions
  - Work done in each step
  - Gas used per transaction
  - Slippage realized
  - Final balances and pool states (where supported)
- The randomized cadence helps to avoid simple, repetitive patterns, which is important when modeling how a real wallet would behave.

Randomization and Timers
- Randomization aims to reflect human-like behavior. The approach centers on:
  - A seedable random function to generate intervals
  - A distribution that favors short pauses with occasional longer ones
  - Constraints to keep intervals within practical boundaries
- Timers are implemented using asynchronous sleep patterns that do not block the event loop.
- If you want tighter control, you can override the randomness with a deterministic cadence during testing.

Wallet and Key Management
- The bot uses a private key to sign transactions. Protect this key as you would for any sensitive credential.
- If you need to rotate credentials, implement a secure key management approach and update the configuration accordingly.
- Consider separating signing from application logic for more robust security in production environments.

Swapping Logic and Slippage Handling
- The bot evaluates swap routes with price and liquidity awareness.
- It uses a nominal slippage tolerance to accept price moves during the swap window.
- If a swap would exceed the tolerance, the bot can skip that path and try another route or wait for the next cycle.
- The implementation supports multiple routes and fallbacks to maximize successful cycles while controlling risk.

Observability: Logging, Metrics, and Debugging
- Every cycle logs key events: wrap, swap, and unwrap steps, including outcomes and gas usage.
- Logs include token balances before and after each action to enable precise balance tracking.
- Debug mode provides verbose output for development and troubleshooting.
- You can route logs to files or external systems for long-term analysis.

Testing and Validation
- Test in a sandbox environment that mimics Taiko network behavior.
- Validate that wrapping and unwrapping work as expected with your chosen wallet and contracts.
- Confirm that swap paths execute as configured and that the cycle completes within expected time frames.
- Run multiple cycles to stress test timing, gas estimation, and error handling.
- Use emitted metrics to verify that randomization produces the desired distribution of cycle lengths.

Extending and Customizing
- Add or remove tokens from the swap path.
- Introduce additional cycles, such as rotating through different base tokens or adding a secondary wallet to test multi-wallet flows.
- Swap path priorities can be adjusted to emphasize speed, cost, or reliability.
- You can swap through different DEXes if you extend the routing logic.
- The codebase is modular to facilitate such extensions without rewriting core components.

Security Considerations (Operational Hygiene)
- Keep private keys secure. Prefer secure storage and restricted access in production environments.
- Limit exposure by running the bot behind secure networks and only on trusted machines.
- Use test networks to validate changes before deploying on main networks or live environments.
- Regularly review dependencies for security vulnerabilities.

Deployment Scenarios
- Local development: Run with a local Taiko node or a public testnet endpoint to validate functionality.
- Continuous testing: Integrate with CI to run automated checks for new changes and ensure the correct routing of swaps.
- Research experiments: Use the bot to simulate load and measure how liquidity changes respond under different conditions.
- Demonstrations: Show how automated wallets can cycle through tokens and how gas dynamics affect timing and costs.

Deep Dive: How the Cycle Works Step by Step
- Initialization: The bot loads configuration, validates environment variables, and connects to the Taiko network.
- Balance Check: It reads the ETH balance and, if necessary, internal WETH holdings to determine whether wrapping is needed.
- Wrapping: If ETH balance is sufficient, the bot wraps ETH to WETH in preparation for swaps. Wrapping is a standard ERC-20 operation that creates WETH tokens in the same account.
- WETH to USDC Swap: The bot selects a path to swap WETH into USDC. It checks price quotes, gas estimates, and current pool liquidity. If the expected outcome meets the configured tolerances, the swap is executed.
- USDC to ETH Swap: After obtaining USDC, the bot proceeds to swap back to ETH. This step also relies on path selection, price checks, and gas estimation. The goal is to end the cycle with a net ETH position that mirrors a typical wallet‚Äôs behavior.
- Cycle Completion: The bot logs the results, including gas used, slippage realized, and final balances. It then waits for a randomized delay before starting another cycle.
- Error Handling: If any step fails, the bot logs the error, halts the current cycle, and follows a safe retry policy according to configuration. The retry policy keeps the system robust while avoiding runaway behavior.

Migration Path and Future Enhancements
- You can migrate the project to newer versions of Node.js or to different libraries with minimal changes thanks to the modular design.
- Planned enhancements include additional swap paths, multi-wallet testing capabilities, and richer metrics for performance analysis.
- The architecture accommodates experimentation with other assets and network configurations while preserving core loop semantics.

Practical Tips for Real-World Use
- Start with a small, safe testnet configuration to observe behavior and validate timing.
- Use deterministic logging to trace how each cycle interacts with the network.
- Bootstrap a small dataset for testing that mirrors expected balances to avoid surprises in live tests.
- Monitor gas prices and pool liquidity to keep cycles efficient and cost-effective.

Illustrative Scenarios
- Scenario A: Short cadence with low slippage. The bot completes many quick cycles, allowing you to study micro-movements and gas dynamics in a fast loop.
- Scenario B: Moderate cadence with moderate slippage. This setup helps you see how price impact interacts with cycle timing and how often swaps meet slippage tolerances.
- Scenario C: Long cadence with tight slippage. This configuration emphasizes reliability and stability of cycles over longer time frames.
